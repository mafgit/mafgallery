- A free stock image website, that fetches data from Pixabay's API.
- You would need an <b>API Key</b> for this website to work properly, so go to https://pixabay.com/api/docs/ to get an API Key for <b>free</b>.
# How to make it work
- Create a file in the same directory as main.js named:
```
config.js
```
- Copy the following code inside 'config.js' but replace the value of MY_KEY with your Pixabay API key in quotation marks.
```javascript
let config = {
  MY_KEY: '',
};
```
